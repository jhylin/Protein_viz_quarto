This Quarto extension embeds a Molstar interactive viewer inside a Quarto markdown document. The main advantage of this is that it could be useful for reporting purposes across multi-disciplinary teams, particularly if the projects involve using protein structures, e.g. structure-based drug design. The only thing to note that this is for HTML pages only (rendered from Quarto documents).

### Example using RCSB PDB

Retrieve a protein from the RCSB PDB:

`{{{< mol-rcsb 4mqt >}}}`

{{< mol-rcsb 4mqt >}}


Click on the ligand to focus or zoom-in on the ligand bound to receptor protein. This shows most of the chemical interactions between the protein receptor and ligand bound to it (e.g. hydrogen bondings between the ligand and amino acid residues).

MD trajectories and screenshots available.
